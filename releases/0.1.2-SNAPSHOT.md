# 0.1.2-SNAPSHOT

Fifth snapshot release of RainbowCake.

## What's new:

### New Navigator method to execute pending actions together

Previously, sequences of `Navigator` method calls have always executed individually, e.g. take this call:

```kotlin
navigator?.run {
    popUntil(HomeFragment::class)
    add(SomeFragment())
}
``` 

Here, the current Fragments on top of `HomeFragment` would have first been removed, `HomeFragment` appeared for a split second, and _then_ `SomeFragment` would be added on top.

You can now prevent this "flashing" behaviour by calling `navigator.executePending()` after a series of actions, like so:

```kotlin
navigator?.run {
    popUntil(HomeFragment::class)
    add(SomeFragment())
    executePending()
}
```

#### Version updates: 

- Kotlin 1.3.21
- Android Gradle plugin 3.3.1
