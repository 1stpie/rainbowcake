# *0.3.0*

Seventh release of RainbowCake.

## What's new:

### Channels artifact

Channel related code has now been moved from the core library to the `rainbow-cake-channels` artifact. It also includes a new feature, converting a `LiveData` instance to a `Channel`:

```kotlin
fun getNews(): ReceiveChannel<List<News>> {
    return newsDao.getNews().toChannel()
}
```

This, as with other Channel related API, is experimental (but seems to work alright).

_(Flow support of various forms is also coming soon.)_

## Changes:

### Navigation extension reorganization

Argument handling extensions have been moved from the core library to the navigation artifact. Their package names have also been changed to reflect this change. The old extensions are now deprecated.

### Documentation

The previously used [documentation repo](https://gitlab.autsoft.hu/AutSoft/AndroidChapter/rainbow-cake/rainbow-cake-guide) is now deprecated. See [rainbowcake.dev](https://rainbowcake.dev) instead. 

### Version updates: 

- Coroutines 1.2.0
