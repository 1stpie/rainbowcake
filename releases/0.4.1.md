# *0.4.1*

Ninth release of RainbowCake.

## What's new:

### ViewState handling fixes

Version 0.4.0 caused some unexpected behaviour when reading the `viewState` immediately after setting it to a new value, as continuously blocking the thread between these two operations didn't allow the set operation to complete, therefore the read showed an outdated state. This should be fixed now.

The `postState` method is now even more deprecated than before. You should *really* only update state via `viewState` and from the UI thread. Please.
