# *0.5.0*

Thirteenth release of RainbowCake.

## What's new:

### Internal changes to ViewModel scopes

Instead of implementing `CoroutineScope` in `JobViewModel`, it now contains a `CoroutineScope` instance, which falls in line with many recommendations regarding scopes, as well as the classic advice of favouring composition over inheritance.

This _should_ be an internal only change, but if you've been abusing the scope interface on ViewModels to launch coroutines on them from Fragments, it's a potentially breaking change.

### First release of `rainbow-cake-test`

The architecture now ships with a dedicated testing module, which supports unit testing the architecture (Yay! ðŸŽ‰). This testing module is in an experimental status, as it itself relies on experimental coroutine testing libraries at this point.

#### Presenter testing

For Presenter tests, you can use the `PresenterTest` base class, which will replace the IO dispatcher used in Presenters with the test dispatcher, to make it execute immediately:

#### ViewModel testing

For ViewModel tests, you can use the `ViewModelTest` base class, which will replace the Main dispatcher used by the `execute` method with the test dispatcher, and also replace the internal `LiveData` executor with a mock executor that executes everything on a single thread, in a blocking manner.

The difficult part of testing ViewModels is having to observe their reactions to inputs through various `LiveData`-based mechanisms - both state changes and events work this way. To make this easy, the `rainbow-cake-test` library provides the `observeStateAndEvents` function that lets you assert changes to state, as well as any emitted events:

```kotlin
vm.observeStateAndEvents { stateObserver, eventsObserver ->
    vm.loadArticle(1L)
    stateObserver.assertObserved(Loading, ArticleLoaded())
    vm.loadArticle(-1L)
    eventsObserver.assertObserved(InvalidIdError)
}
```

See the extensions on the `MockObserver` class for the currently available assertions. Note that you can also add your own assertion extensions on this class, as needed.

#### All other tests

Testing other, lower level components such as Interactors or Data Sources should not require additional support from the architecture. You can use the experimental [coroutines test library](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/kotlinx-coroutines-test) to wrap such tests in `runBlockingTest` calls.
