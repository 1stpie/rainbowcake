# *0.6.0*

Fourteenth release of RainbowCake.

## What's new:

### Small stuff

- The reified `popUntil` extension used to return `Unit` instead of `Boolean`, which is what the original method returns to indicate if popping happened. Fixed!
- ViewModel instances are now set in `onAttach` instead of `onCreate`. Because there was no real reason to wait until `onCreate` to do this. 
- `ViewModelProviders` has been deprecated, so now `ViewModelProvider` is being used directly.
- Version updates (Gradle 6.2.2, AGP 3.6.1, Kotlin 1.3.70).
- Revamped publishing setup for the libraries.
