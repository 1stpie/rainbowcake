# *1.0.0*

Sixteenth release of RainbowCake.

## What's new:

### Removed deprecated constructs

A handful or previously deprecated pieces of code are now removed. If you want to migrate away from them, use `0.7.0` and IDE migration features before upgrading to `1.0.0`.
 
- `JobViewModel`: replace usages with `RainbowCakeViewModel`
- `RainbowCakeViewModel#postEvent`: update view state from the UI thread instead
_ Navigation extensions in `co.zsmb.rainbowcake.extensions`: use the methods from the `co.zsmb.rainbowcake.navigation.extensions` package instead
- The `rainbow-cake-channels` artifact: use [Flows](https://rainbowcake.dev/best-practices/flows/) instead

The `JobViewModel` class, previously deprecated, has now been removed. Use `0.7.0` to quickly migrate to `RainbowCakeViewModel`.

### Small stuff

- **ViewModels are now initialized in `onCreate` instead of `onAttach`**

- Improved internal logging
- Updated Koin & Dagger to latest version
